      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

<!--Coding Steps:

    Using Create-React-App or Vite, create a new React project. Create a LoginForm component that contains the following:
        Username and password input fields, an h3 that says Log In, with a border. Style the component using the default generated CSS file.
    Create a Navigation component that contains links styled like a navbar.
        The links don't have to go anywhere.
    Put the Navigation component at the top of the page and the LoginForm in the center of the page.
